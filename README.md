# 6-Color-Theorem- March 2020

This project was completed as part of the Math 61- Discrete Structures Honors Contract. Through this program, I met with the class' professor once a week outside of regularly scheduled lectures and office hours to explore more complex problems and proofs.

Using the Python package networkx and matplotlib.pyplot, I implemented the Six Color Theorem so that the program would input a graph's nodes and vertices and output a displayed 6-coloring of the inputted graph. The  Six Color Theorem states that every planar graph's nodes can be colored with six different colors so that no two adjacent nodes are the same color.

The PDF file contains some of the proofs written as part of this project and the pseudocode for the notebook. Contained are proofs of the Five and Six Color Theorems.
